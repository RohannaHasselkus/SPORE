# SPORE â€“ Systems-Level Program for Organizing Regulatory Elements (Fungi)

SPORE is a **fungi-focused extension of the GRAND database**, designed to organize and analyze gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in fungal species.

---

## Project Overview

SPORE enables researchers to:

- Compile and organize transcription factor (TF) and target gene information in fungi.  
- Analyze regulatory interactions across developmental stages.  
- Integrate motif scanning and expression data for dynamic network inference.  
- Visualize gene regulatory networks to study rewiring events during fungal development.

This project complements the **UNAGI algorithm**, which performs unipartite network inference for regulatory analysis.

## Features

- **Fungi-focused database** with curated TF-target relationships.  
- **Motif-informed network inference** to identify dynamic rewiring events.  
- **Visualization tools** for exploring GRNs across stages.  
- **R-based implementation** compatible with common bioinformatics workflows.
